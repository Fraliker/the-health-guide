    "summary": "Sugars are carbohydrates with only one (monosaccharides) and two (disaccharides) sugar units, hence the term simple carbohydrates. Sugars bring no benefits to our body, on the contrary, they damage our body. Sugars are rapidly absorbed and cause blood glucose spikes and high insulin secretion. Natural sugars from fruits and vegetables come along with fiber which slows down absorption. The real problem comes from refined sugars (sweeteners), which cause inflammation within our digestive system and cardiovascular system leading to health problems. They are found in all processed foods and desserts. Reduce sugars to less than 5% of daily energy intake."
