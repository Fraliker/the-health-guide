    "summary": "Vitamin B7, Vitamin H, coenzyme R or Biotin is an essential water-soluble nutrient, hence, it cannot be stored and is easily eliminated from the body through urine or perspiration. It is part of the vitamin B-complex family and works together with the rest of the B vitamins. A deficiency of any of the B vitamins disrupts the function of the entire group. Vitamin B7 is essential for amino acid and fat metabolism and fatty acid production",
