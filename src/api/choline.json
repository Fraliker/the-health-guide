It is related to the B Vitamins, but not considered yet one of them. Choline is essential for liver (fat metabolism), pregnancy, neuromuscular juctions involved in all muscular activities (heart, intestines, skeletal muscles, stomach, etc.), and mental arousal (alertness, attention, learning, memory, mood, rewards system etc.)",
