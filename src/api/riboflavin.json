    "summary": "Vitamin B2 or Riboflavin is an essential water-soluble nutrient, hence, it cannot be stored and is easily eliminated from the body through urine or perspiration. It is part of the vitamin B-complex family and works together with the rest of the B vitamins. A deficiency of any of the B vitamins disrupts the function of the entire group. Vitamin B2 is essential for energy production (metabolism) and redox reactions such as cellular respiration, electron transfer between molecules, and protection against free radicals (Reactive oxygen species or ROS) that cause oxidative stress (cellular damage that leads to aging, DNA mutations, inflammation, and others)",
