    "summary": "Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential trace element. It is essential for xanthine oxidase (XO) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) production, which are involved in detoxification (uric acid production) growth (protein production), energy production (iron, protein, and vitamin B metabolism), vision (corneal epithelium and endothelium oxidative damage protection), and redox reactions such as cellular respiration and protection against free radicals (Reactive oxygen species or ROS) that cause oxidative stress (cellular damage that leads to aging, DNA mutations, inflammation, and others)",
