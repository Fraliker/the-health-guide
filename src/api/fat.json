    "summary": "Fatty acids or fats are lipids that serve as secondary energy supply, when glucose is absent, along with other important functions. Fatty acids are classified as unsaturated fatty acids (fluid at low temperature and unstable) and saturated fatty acids (solid at low temperature and stable). alpha-Linolenic acid (an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) and Linoleic acid (an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) are the only essential fatty acids. Fatty acids are essential for blood vessels, cell membrane, nutrient absorption, endocrine system (hormone production), energy production and storage (metabolism), immune system, and nervous system (neurotransmitter production)",
