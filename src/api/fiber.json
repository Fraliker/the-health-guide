    "summary": "Dietary fiber or roughage is the part from plant foods that we are unable to digest and absorb. It passes through the digestive tract, slowing down digestion. This causes satiety, improved digestion, an increased nutrient absorption, stable glucose and insulin levels, and thus stable cholesterol levels. Fiber can also ferment in the colon, thus, improving the bacterial enzyme (gut flora) health. It is thus essential for digestive system, immunse system, and cardiovascular system",
