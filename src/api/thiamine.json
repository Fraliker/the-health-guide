    "summary": "Vitamin B1 or Thiamine is an essential water-soluble nutrient, hence, it cannot be stored and is easily eliminated from the body through urine or perspiration. It is part of the vitamin B-complex family and works together with the rest of the B vitamins. A deficiency of any of the B vitamins disrupts the function of the entire group. Vitamin B1 is essential for energy production (metabolism), neuromuscular juctions involved in all muscular activities (heart, intestines, skeletal muscles, stomach, etc.), and mental arousal (alertness, attention, learning, memory, rewards system etc.)",
