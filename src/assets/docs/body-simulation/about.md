The best whey to diagnose and heal is:
- find the feeling/effect/output;
- find the past inputs/causes that may have generated these outputs;
- find matches/links between inputs and outputs and determine the current state and other possible side effects;
- find lifestyle changes and solutions/inputs that would replace the bad inputs and fill the gaps `in time`.
