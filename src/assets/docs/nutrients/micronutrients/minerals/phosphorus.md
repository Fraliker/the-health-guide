Phosphorus (P) is an essential mimeral element

## Functions and Health support
- `Blood pH levels stabilisation`;
- `Bone health`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Energy production`;
- `Growth`;
- `Metabolism`;
- `Muscle movements and strength`;
- `Teeth health`.

## Important relationships
- Vitamin B-complex - Energy procution, Growth, and Metabolism;

## Daily recommendations
- Men: 700mg/day;
- Women: 700mg/day;

- Lactation: 700mg/day.

## Food sources

- Confusion;
- Dental problems;
- Growth impairment in children;
- Muscle problems (Numbness, Tingling, Twitching, Weakness);
- Weakness.

## Watch out's
