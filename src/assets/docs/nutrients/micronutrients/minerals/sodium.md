# Sodium (N)
Sodium (N) is an essential mineral element.

## Functions and Health support
- `Blood pH levels stabilisation`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Fluid levels stabilisation`;
- `Mental functions`: Attention, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding;
- `Muscle health`.

## Important relationships
- Chloride - Mental functions, Muscle health, Blood pH and fluid levels stabilisation.

## Daily recommendations
- Men: 1500mg/day;
- Women: 1500mg/day;
- Pregnancy: 1500mg/day;
- Lactation: 1500mg/day.

## Food sources
- Tables salt;
- Seafood;
- Meat.

## Deficiency signs
- Concentration difficulties;
- Dizziness;
- Excess thirst;
- Insomnia;
- Irritability;
- Low blood pressure;
- Memory problems;
- Muscle cramps;
- Nausea;
- Sleepiness;
- Swelling;
- Weakness;
- Weight loss.

## Watch out's
- 98% Sodium is absorbed.

- Absorption is `impaired` by:
    - Added sugars;
    - Age;
    - Alcohol;
    - Caffeine;
    - Gastrointestinal problems;
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Potassium;
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;
    - Stress.

- Absorption `requires`:
    - Chloride.

- Excess Sodium causes:
    - Blood vessel damage (High blood pressure);
    - Fluid retention;
    - Potassium absorption impairment.
