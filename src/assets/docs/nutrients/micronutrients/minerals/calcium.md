- `Bone health`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;

- Magnesium, Phosphorus, Vitamin D - Bone health.

## Mechanism of action

- Heart palpitations;
- Irregular heartbeats;
- Insomnia;
- Irritability;
- Muscle cramps;

    - Caffeine;
    - Excess fat;
    - Excess Phosphorus
    - Excess protein;
    - Excess Sodium;
    - Gastrointestinal problems;
    - Non-organic milk;
    - Oxalic acid (Green vegetables);
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Phytic acid (Whole-grains);
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;

    - Zinc.

- Absorption `requires`:
    - Acid medium;
    - Fat;
    - Magnesium;
    - Protein;
    - Vitamin C;
    - Vitamin D.

- Excess Calcium `impairs`:
    - Iron absorption;
    - Magnesium absorption;
    - Phosphorus absorption;
    - Zinc absorption.
