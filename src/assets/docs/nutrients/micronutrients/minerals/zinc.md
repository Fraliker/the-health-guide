## Watch out's
- Zinc `absorption is slow and delicate`:
	- 20-40% Iron is absorbed.

- Absorption is `impaired` by:
    - Added sugars;
    - Age;
    - Alcohol;
    - Caffeine;
    - Calcium;
    - Copper;
    - Gastrointestinal problems;
    - Iron;
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Phosphorus;
    - Phytic acid (Whole-grains);
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;
    - Stress.

- Absorption `requires`:
    - 'Heme' foods (Meat);
	- Protein;

- Excess Zinc `impairs`:
    - Copper absorption;
    - Folate (Vitamin B9) absorption;
    - Iron absorption.
