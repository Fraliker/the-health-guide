# Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)
Vitamin B1 or Thiamine is an essential water-soluble nutrient, hence, it cannot be stored and is easily eliminated from the body through urine or perspiration.

## Actions

- Carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism via TPP;
- Ethanol convertion to water and carbon dioxide via TPP;
- Fatty acid and cholesterol production and convertion of carbohydrates to fat storage via TPP;
- Acetylcholine formation via Acetyl CoA production.
