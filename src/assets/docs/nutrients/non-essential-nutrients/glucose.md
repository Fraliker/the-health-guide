# What is glucose?
Glucose is the a carbohydrate (sugar) that serves as energy fuel for all cells. It is the final product of carbohydrate digestion. It travels in the blood after every until it is either burnt by cells, either stored as energy in form of fat and glycogen. Thus, glucose is also called `Blood sugar`.

# Why are sugars bad?
Because of their simple form, sugars are rapidly reduced to glucose. Glucose is rapidly absorbed and causes high amounts of insulin to be secreted by the pancreas at once to stabilize it. Cells require a limited amount of glucose at once, hence, the excess must be converted and stored. 

Glucose in the blood is regulated by `Insulin`, a hormone secreted by the pancreas.

> __Insulin "feeds" the cells with the glucose they need and stores the excess in tissues__.

When there is too much glucose in the blood at once, insulin stores it for later use in form of `Glycogen` (muscles and liver) through `Glycogenesis` and `Adipose tissue` (organs and under the skin) through `Lipogenesis`. On the other hand, when the cells are "hungry", but there is not enough glucose in the blood, glucose is obtained by conversion from the energy deposits (fat and glycogen) or from amino acids (e.g. muscle fibers), process known as `Gluconeogenesis`.

> __Glucose conversion happens only in the presence of `Glucagon` and `Epinephrine (Adrenaline)`, the latter being released during exercise and as a response to fear and in the abscence of insulin__.

Glucose levels in the blood is called `Glycemic index`. The more complex the carbohydrates, the slower the digestion and absorption of glucose, hence, the lower the glycemic index. Thus, __Sugars have high glycemic index, whereas complex carbohydrates have low glycemic index__.

Also, high amounts of insulin need to be transported - _pumped_ - through the blood vessels. This creates high tension on the blood vessels and a big task for the heart, not to mention the high amounts of energy cause by glucose which also stimulates the blood flow.

> __Long-term insulin and glucose spikes damage the blood vessels, the heart, the pancreas, and leads to weight gain and, probably, obesity.__
