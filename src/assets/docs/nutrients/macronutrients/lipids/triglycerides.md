# Triglycerides (Fatty acids)

Tryglicerides, Fatty acids, or, simply, Fats are the major type of lipids found in food and our body (95%). They are made of chains of carbon attached to hydrogen molecules. The less hydrogen molecules, the greater the number of double bonds between carbons, and the lower the saturation. Hence, fats are classified according to their degree of saturation.

> __Saturated fats are solid at room temperature, whereas unsaturated fats are fluid.__

## Cis monounsaturated fatty acids
Monounsaturated fats have only one hydrogen molecule removed, thus, one double bond between carbon atoms. They can be produced by the body, hence, __they are non-essential__.

### Daily recommendations
- 10% daily energy intake.

### Food sources
- Sunflower oil;
- Hazelnut oil;
- Canola oil;
- Olive oil;
- Avocado oil;
- Almond oil;
- Fish oil;
- Sunflower seeds;
- Olives;
- Avocado;
- Nuts;
- Egg yolk;
- Meats.

## Cis polyunsaturated fatty acids
Polyunsaturated fats have more than one hydrogen molecule removed, thus, many double bonds between carbon atoms. They contain __the only essential fats: `Alpha-Linolenic acid` (Omega-3 fatty acid) and `Linoleic acid` (Omega-6 fatty acid)__.

### Daily recommendations
- 15% daily energy intake.

### Food sources
- Safflower oil;
- Grapeseed oil;
- Flaxseed oil;
- Walnut oil;
- Poppyseed oil;
- Soybean oil;
- Hemp oil;
- Sunflower oil;
- Oat oil;
- Fish oil;
- Flaxseeds;
- Walnuts;
- Butternuts;
- Pine nuts.
- Hemp seeds;
- Sunflower seeds;
- Poppy seeds.

## Saturated fatty acids
Saturated fats have all hydrogen molecules attached, thus, no double bonds between carbon atoms. They can be produced by the body, hence, __they are non-essential__.

### Daily recommendations
- 5% daily energy intake.

## Food sources
- Palm oil;
- Refined coconut oil;
- Butter;
- Red meat;
- Dairy.

## Trans fatty acids
Trans fats are unsaturated fats that have been forcely hidrogenated (saturated) for stabilisation and better preservation. They are found in processed and comercial products. __They are non-essential and damage the body__.

### Daily recommendations
- 0% daily energy intake.

### Food sources
- Industrial oil;
- Margarine;
- Shortening;
- Cookies;
- Crackers;
- Popcorn;
- Candies;
- Potato chips;
- Fast foods;
- Comercial meat.

## Watch out's
> __Dietary cholesterol from animal foods is not the same with blood cholesterol.__

- Excess Saturated fats cause:
    - Cardiovascular system damage (Blood vessels, Heart);
    - Weight gain.

- Trans fats consumption cause:
    - Cell membrane damage;
    - Cell nucleus (DNA) damage;
    - Cardiovascular system damage (Blood vessels, Heart);
    - Weight gain.
