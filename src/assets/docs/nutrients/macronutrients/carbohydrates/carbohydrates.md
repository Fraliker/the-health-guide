# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or, simply, Carbs are macronutrients that serve as __the primary energy source for our body__. They provide the fuel - `Glucose` - needed by our cells to accomplish their functions. 

Yet, our body can obtain glucose by conversion from amino acids and fats, hence, carbohydrates are not essential nutrients. The problem is, if amino acids and fats are used for fuel, then there will be none left for the rest of the important body processes. _It would be like using the machinery and the workers in a factory as energy supply_; there would be nothing left to accomplish the overall purpose of the factory.

> __It is better to let our body get its fuel from carbohydrates and let it use amino acids and fat for their main purpose.__

The brain and red blood cells are the only ones which require glucose exclusevily for energy, because they are unable to create energy from amino acids or fats.

Carbohydrates are chains of sugar units called `Saccharides` and are classified based on their structure.

## Classification
- `Simple carbohydrates (Sugars)`
    - Monosaccharides;
    - Disaccharides.
- `Complex carbohydrates`
    - Glycogen - energy storage in the liver and muscles;
    - Starch - energy storage in plants. The most common type of carbydrates (e.g. potatoes, grains, legumes, root vegetables);
    - Fiber - the part from plants that is not digestible (e.g. skin and bran). Improves nutrient digestion (absorption) and elimination of intestinal wastes (detoxification).

## Functions and Health support
- `Energy production`;
- `Mental functions`: Attention, Behaviour, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Social, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding;
- `Positive attitude`;
- `Red blood cells function`.

## Daily recommendations
- 50% daily energy intake.

## Food sources
- Simple carbohydrates:
    - Sweeteners;
    - Desserts;
    - Candy;
    - Fruits.
- Complex carbohydrates:
    - Whole-grains;
    - Vegetables;
    - Legumes.

## Deficiency symptoms
- Anxiety;
- Balance loss;
- Breathing difficulties;
- Coldness;
- Confusion;
- Depression;
- Dizziness;
- Fatigue;
- Headache;
- Heart palpitaions;
- Hunger;
- Indifference;
- Intellectual disability (Attention, Behaviour, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Social, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding problems);
- Irritability;
- Mood swings;
- Motivation decrease;
- Nausea;
- Nervousness;
- Paleness;
- Shakiness;
- Sleepiness or Tiredness;
- Sweating;
- Vision problems;
- Weakness;
- Weight loss.

## Watch out's
- Complex carbohydrates are the only type of carbohydrates that bring benefits to our body, hence, you cannot be deficient of sugars.
- Reduce sugar intake as much as you can for optimal health (5% daily energy intake).
