# Simple carbohydrates (Sugars)
Simple carbohydrates or, simply, Sugars have only one and two sugar units. 

> __Sugars are all the organic compounds with "-ose" at the end__.

## Monosaccharides
- `Glucose` - Energy fuel; the absorbed form of carbohydrates in the blood after digestion;
- `Fructose` - Found in fruits and honey;
- `Galactose` - Obtained from Lactose;

## Disaccharides
- `Sucrose (White sugar)` - Found mostly in table sugar and sweets;
- `Lactose (Milk sugar)` - Found mostly in milk;
- `Maltose (Malt sugar)` - Found mostly in grains.

## Daily recommendations
- 5% daily energy intake.

## Food sources
- Sweeteners (e.g. white sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, corn syrup, corn-syrup solids, high-fructose corn syrup, malt syrup, maple syrup, pancake syrup, fructose sweetener, liquid fructose, honey, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, and crystal dextrose);
- Candy;
- Desserts (e.g. cakes, cookies, pies);
- Processed food;
- Dried fruits;
- Grapes;
- Bananas;
- Apples;
- Plums;
- Pineapples;
- Pears.

## Watch out's
- Sugars found in comercial and processed foods are `Artificial sweeteners ("Added sugars")` and bring greater damage to the body. Chemically, they are similar to natural sugars, but the foods that contain them have no nutritional value, hence the name `Empty calories`.
- Excess Sugars cause:
    - Bone damage;
    - Cardiovascular system damage (Blood vessels, Heart);
    - Digestive system damage (Intestines, Liver, Pancreas, Stomach, Teeth);
    - Weight gain.
