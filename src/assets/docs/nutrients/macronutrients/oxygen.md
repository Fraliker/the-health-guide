# Oxygen
Oxygen is the most important nutrient for life on Earth. We can survive without food for weeks, without water for days, but we can't survive without oxygen more than a few minutes. We are 65% water and water is 89% oxygen, hence, oxygen is the most abundant element in our body.

## Functions and Health support
- `80% of all our metabolic energy production is created by oxygen`;
- `purified blood stream`
    - vitality and rejuvenation
- `Detoxification`
    - bums up the waste products (toxins) in the body
- `Energy`
    - recharging the body's batteries (the solar plexus).

## Facts
- you can reverse arterial disease in monkeys by infusing oxygen into the diseased arteries (Baylor University in the USA);
- emotional stress produces adrenaline and adrenaline-related hormones, requiring the body to draw on its oxygen reserves for their production and eventual oxidation.
- the body combats excess acidity is by trying to neutralize it with oxygen.
- exercises increases blood oxygen levels which, in change, produces more energy and accelerates the oxidation of taxic wastes.
- improper breathing produces diminished mental ability and vice versa.
- the heart never makes cancer, because it is the orgna with the greatest amount of oxygen from the body (the epicenter of oxygenation)

## Mechanism
Oxygen is transported by red blood cells via hemoglobin binding (turning dark red to light red) and given to enzymes. Enzymes uses oxygen to burn - oxidize - catalyze many oxidation reactions in the body (metabolism) realising carbon dioxide (wastes).

Some small parts of wastes that are water soluble are removed by urine and sweat by other require deep burning - oxidation -  with help from oxygen.

## Free radicals

There are some types of oxygen molecules that are instable (radioacitve) and cause damage to cell membranes and DNA leading to degradation and mutations.

Electrons in atoms spin around in pairs, like in a dance. When an atom as an electron without a pair its said to be unstable, because the single electrons steal electron pairs from neighbouring atoms making them unstable as well.

> Dr. Tai likes to say, the oxidation of cells by free radicals makes the human body "rust" like oxidation of metal makes it rust - and you know what rust does to the strength and natural beauty of the metal.

Free radicals also occur created as part of the waste products or normal cellular metabolic activities.

Antoxidants have the power to donate electrons to neutralize free radicals without becoming unstable. They also have the power to reverse the dmagae, not only prevent it, thus, increasing vitality and lifespan (youth).

## Oxygen and brain

The brain represents only 2% of the human body weight; it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization.
The energy consumption for the brain to simply survive is 0.1 calories per minute, while this value can be as high as 1.5 calories per minute during crossword puzzle-solving.
When neurons in a particular region of the brain are highly active, they consume a great deal of oxygen, which results in recruitment of extra blood flow to that region.
Mental performance in the human body can be improved by "feeding" the brain with extra oxygen or glucose.

Brain cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation and can begin to die within five minutes after oxygen supply has been cut off. Decrease of oxygen supply to the brain even though there is adequate blood flow caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, pollution in our cities, choking or suffocation can create conditions like tiredness, depression, irritability, poor judgment and health problems.

Increasing the oxygen supply to the brain and nervous system will reverse these conditions. The oxygen regimen improves alertness, reflexes, memory and apparently intelligence, and may offer the elderly a new weapon against senility and related disorders. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are reported to be responding to it. Alcoholics who start taking oxygen supplement soon loose interest in alcohol.

## The diet's role in oxygen shortages and life-support.

Eating junk food on a regular basis forces the body to use up more of its oxygen reserves than usual in order to metabolize the preservatives and what few nutrients may actually be in the "food". Complex carbohydrates and raw fruits and vegetables are high in oxygen with as much as 50% of the weight of these foods made up of oxygen. The percentage of oxygen in fats is less than 15% while the percentage of oxygen in protein is between 20% and 40%, depending on the protein's amino acid profile. Dense food compounds, such as fats and proteins, are not only low in oxygen content, but also require extra oxygen from the body to convert them into energy which further depletes the body's oxygen reserves. Other oxygen-robbing foods include processed sugar, white flour, alcohol and caffeinated drinks — definitely not part of a life-support diet. The body has to divert needed oxygen from primary metabolic functions, such as heartbeat, blood flow, brain function and immune response, just to oxidize and metabolize these foods.

Element	Percent by mass
Oxygen (O)	65
Carbon (C)	18
Hydrogen (H)	10
Nitrogen (N)	3
Calcium (Ca)	1.5
Phosphorus (P)	1.2
Potassium (K)	0.2
Sulfur (S)	0.2
Chlorine (Cl)	0.2
Sodium (Na)	0.1
Magnesium (Mg)	0.05
Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co), Zinc (Zn), Iodine (I)	<0.05 each
Selenium (Se), Fluorine (F)	<0.05 each

99% of the mass of the human body is made up of the six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus.

Carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen.
Amino acids are the only ones with nitrogen.

## Oxygen and bacteria
Most bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and other infectious agents are anaerobic and cannot survive in oxigenated medium.
Some research indicates that when the oxygen content of the body is within a normal level, infectious microorganisms have a more difficult time breeding and multiplying. The partial pressure of oxygen in normal blood should be approximately 97%. Within each red blood cell are iron-rich hemoglobin molecules. Approximately 97% of the oxygen carried to the cells is attached to these hemoglobin molecules with 3% of the oxygen supply dissolved in the blood plasma. When your blood oxygen levels remain low for extended periods of time, the cells cannot get an adequate and consistent supply of oxygen and they may have difficulty resisting the invasion of microorganisms — lessening your natural life-support.

## Breathing
> _"Breathing may be considered the most important of all the functions of the body, for, indeed, all the other functions depend upon it."_ - Ramacharaka: Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath

### Benefits of deep breathing
- Improvement in the quality of the blood due to its increased oxygenation in the lungs. This aids in the elimination of toxins from the system.
- Increase in the digestion and assimilation of food. The digestive organs such as the stomach receive more oxygen, and hence operates more efficiently. The digestion is further enhanced by the fact that the food is oxygenated more.
- Improvement in the health of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, nerve centers and nerves. This is due again to the increased oxygenation and hence nourishment of the nervous system. This improves the health of the whole body, since the nervous system communicates to all parts of the body.
- Rejuvenation of the glands, especially the pituitary and pineal glands. The brain has a special affinity for oxygen, requiring three times more oxygen than does the rest of the body. This has far-reaching effects on our well being.
- Rejuvenation of the skin. The skin becomes smoother and a reduction of facial wrinkles occurs.
- The movements of the diaphragm during the deep breathing exercise massage the abdominal organs - the stomach, small intestine, liver and pancreas. The upper movement of the diaphragm also massages the heart. This stimulates the blood circulation in these organs.
- The lungs become healthy and powerful, a good insurance against respiratory problems.
- Deep, slow, yoga breathing reduces the work load for the heart. The result is a more efficient, stronger heart that operates better and lasts longer. It also mean reduced blood pressure and less heart disease.
- The yoga breathing exercises reduce the work load on the heart in two ways. Firstly, deep breathing leads to more efficient lungs, which means more oxygen is brought into contact with blood sent to the lungs by the heart. So, the heart doesn't have to work as hard to deliver oxygen to the tissues. Secondly, deep breathing leads to a greater pressure differential in the lungs, which leads to an increase in the circulation, thus resting the heart a little.
- Deep, slow breathing assists in weight control. If you are overweight, the extra oxygen burns up the excess fat more efficiently. If you are underweight, the extra oxygen feeds the starving tissues and glands. In other words, yoga tends to produce the ideal weight for you.
- Relaxation of the mind and body. Slow, deep, rhythmic breathing causes a reflex stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which results in a reduction in the heart rate and relaxation of the muscles. These two factors cause a reflex relaxation of the mind, since the mind and body are very interdependent. In addition, oxygenation of the brain tends to normalize brain function, reducing excessive anxiety levels.
- The breathing exercises cause an increase in the elasticity of the lungs and rib cage. This creates an increased breathing capacity all day, not just during the actual exercise period. This means all the above benefits also occur all day.

### Breathing impairment
Sedentary person, when confronted with a perplexing problem, tends to lean forward, draw his arms together, and bend his head down. All these body postures results in reduced lung capacity.

One's breathing becomes modified and restricted in various ways we tend to assume positions (slouched positions) that diminishes lung capacities and take shortened breaths. We also live in social conditions that is not good for the health of our respiratory system. 

The more intense the concentration, the more tense the muscles become. The muscles in the arms, neck and chest contract. The muscles that move the thorax and control inhalation and muscular tenseness clamp down and restrict the exhalation. The breaths become shorter and shorter. After an extended period of intense focusing, the whole system seems to be frozen in a certain posture.

We become fatigued from the decreased circulation of the blood and from the decreased availability of oxygen for the blood because we have almost stopped breathing. As our duties, responsibilities and their attendant problems become more demanding, we develop habits of forgetting to breathe.

Try an experiment suggested by Swami Vishnudevananda. Focus attention upon the ticks of a clock placed at a distance of about twelve feet. If you get distracted, try concentrating harder until you experience the ticking with undivided attention. If you fail at first, you should try again and again until you succeed in keeping the ticking clearly in mind for at least a few seconds. What happened? The majority of persons who took part in this experiment reported that they have completely suspended the breath. The others, who had less concentration, reported that they experienced very slow breathing. This experiment shows clearly that where there is concentration of the mind, the breathing becomes very slow or even get suspended temporarily.

We are breathing to quick and shallow. Quick shallow breathing results in oxygen starvation which leads to reduced vitality, premature ageing, poor immune system and a myriad of other factors.

- We are in a hurry most of the time. Our movements and breathing follow this pattern.
- The increasing stress of modern living makes us breathe more quickly and less deeply.
- We get too emotional too easily. We get excited easily, angry easily, and most of the rest of the time we suffer from anxiety due to worry. These negative emotional states affect the rate of breathing, causing it to be fast and shallow.
- Modern technology and automation reduces our need for physical activity. There is less need to breathe deeply, so we develop the shallow breathing habit.
- We are working indoors more and more. This increases our exposure to pollution. As a result, the body instinctively inhales less air to protect itself from pollution. The body just takes in enough air to tick over.
- As we go through life, these bad breathing habits we picked up become part of our life. Unless we do something to reverse these habits, we can suffer permanent problems. The good news is that these are reversible. The bad news is that before we can change these habits, we should recognize and accept that our behavior needs to be changed. This means that we see for ourselves the benefits of good breathing techniques.

Animals which breathe slowly live the longest; the elephant is a good example.

### Importance of Breathing Through The Nose

The first rule for correct breathing is that we should breathe through the nose. This may seem obvious, but many people breathe principally through the mouth. Mouth breathing can adversely affect the development of the thyroid gland. It can retard the mental development of children.

The nose has various defense mechanisms to prevent impurities and excessively cold air entering the body. At the entrance to the nose, a screen of hairs traps dust, tiny insects and other particles that may injure the lungs if you breathe through the mouth. After the entrance of the nose, there is a long winding passage lined with mucus membranes, where excessively cool air is warmed and very fine dust particles that escaped the hair screen are caught. Next, in the inner nose are glands which fight off any bacilli which have slipped through the other defenses. The inner nose also contains the olfactory organ-our sense of smell. This detects any poisonous gases around that may injure our health.

The yogis believe that the olfactory organ has another function: the absorption of prana from the air. If you breathe through the mouth all the time, as many people do, you are cheating yourself of all this free energy (prana). The yogis say this is a major factor in lowered resistance to disease and impairs the functioning of your vital glands and nervous system. Add to this the fact that pathogens can enter the lungs via mouth breathing, and you can see that it's impossible to be healthy, not to mention vital, if you breathe through the mouth.
