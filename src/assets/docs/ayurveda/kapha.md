## Overview
Kapha is formed from Earth and Water and is the energy that forms the body's structure--bones, muscles, tendons--and provides the "glue" that holds the cells together. Kapha supplies the water for all bodily parts and systems. It lubricates joints, moisturizes the skin, and maintains immunity. In balance, kapha is expressed as love, calmness and forgiveness. Out of balance, it leads to attachment, greed and envy.

Kapha is a force created by the dynamic interplay of water and fire. These forces represent transformation. They cannot change into each other, but they modulate or control each other and are vitally required for the life processes to occur. (For example, too much fire and too little water will result in the boiling away of the water. Too much water will result in the fire being put out.)

Kapha governs digestion, absorption, assimilation, nutrition, metabolism, body temperature, skin coloration, the luster of the eyes, intelligence, and understanding. Psychologically, kapha arouses anger, hate, and jealousy. The small intestine, stomach, sweat glands, blood, fat, eyes, and skin are the seats of Kapha.

## Kapha constitution
### Balance
The most important way to balance kapha energy is to get it moving 'shake it up'. Exercise, and dynamism are the key factors that balance kapha. Excess kapha energy is balanced by driness, lightness, and hotness.

### Characteristics
Kapha is defined as cold, dense, heavy, dull, moist, soft, sticky, stable, and static.

### Imbalance factors
Kapha energy is increased by its qualities ('Like increases like') and, thus, becomes imbalanced. Heaviness, moisture, static, and humidity imbalance kapha.

### Imbalance signs
When kapha energy is high, it accumulates in its body locations. Generally, people with kapha constitution tend to become agitated, aggressive with tendency towards anger, hate, and jealousy. They may also notice symptoms as: sluggishness, excess weight, diabetes, water retention, and headaches. Their common type of diseases are water based (e.g. flu, sinus congestion, and other diseases involving mucous).

### Location
Kapha resides in the chest, throat, lungs, head, lymph, fatty tissue, connective tissue, ligaments, and tendons.

### Management
People with kapha constitution are lasy and have difficulties taking action. They earn money and are good at holding on to it and tend to be wealthy. They are very good procrastinators.

### Occurance
During lifetime, kapha energy is most abundant during childhood. During the year, kapha energy is most abundant during winter and spring. During the day, kapha energy is most intense between 6 and 10. When kapha energy is intense, it tends to become out of balance and it is advised to decrease it with opposite qualities.

### Physical patterns
People with kapha constitution are generally well developed, with large body frames, and tend to be overweight. Their general features are: expanded and broad chest, not visible bones, veins, and muscle tendons, well developed muscles, fair and bright complexion, cold, pale, soft, lustrous, and oily skin, dark, soft, thick, and wavy hair, dense, blue or black eyes, large and attractive eyes with very white sclerae and long, thick eyelashes and eyebrows.

### Physiology
People with kapha constitution have a slow metabolism and digestion, and regular appetites. They tend to eat and drink small quantities at one meal. They tend towards sweet, salty and oily foods, although they are balanced by itter, astringent and pungent tastes. They have moderate to low elimination (bowel movements, perspiration, urine). They have a sound and prolonged leep, usually above 8 hours and have difficulties waking up and getting out of bed. They have good stamina and endurance to effort.

### Psychological patterns
People with kapha constitution are generally healthy, happy and peaceful. They are tolerant, calm, forgiving, loving, have slow comprehension, but with complete recall and long-term memory. They have sweet, loving dispositions, and are stable and grounded. They have emotional tendencies toward greed, attachment, envy and possessiveness.

### Qualities
Kapha promotes strength, endurance, and lubrication.
