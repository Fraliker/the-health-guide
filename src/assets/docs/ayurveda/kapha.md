## Overview
Kapha is a force created from the combination of Earth and Water. It is the energy that provides structure to our body (e.g. bones, muscles, and tendons) and the water required by all organ systems and functions (e.g. immune system, skin moisture, joint lubrication). In balance, kapha promotes strength, love, calmness, and forgiveness. When out of balance, kapha promotes attachment, greed, and envy.

## Kapha constitution
### Balance
The most important way to balance kapha energy is to get it moving 'shake it up'. Exercise, and dynamism are the key factors that balance kapha. Excess kapha energy is balanced by driness, lightness, and hotness.

### Characteristics
Kapha is defined as cold, dense, heavy, dull, moist, soft, sticky, stable, and static.

### Imbalance factors
Kapha energy is increased by its qualities ('Like increases like') and, thus, becomes imbalanced. Heaviness, moisture, static, and humidity imbalance kapha.

### Imbalance signs
When kapha energy is high, it accumulates in its body locations. Generally, people with kapha constitution have tendency towards lethargy, attachment, withdrawal, and depression. They may also notice symptoms as: sluggishness, excess weight, diabetes, water retention, and headaches. Their common type of diseases are water based (e.g. flu, sinus congestion, and other diseases involving mucous).

### Location
Kapha resides in the stomach, chest, throat, lungs, head, lymph, fatty tissue, connective tissue, ligaments, and tendons.

### Management
People with kapha constitution are lasy and have difficulties taking action. They earn money and are good at holding on to it and tend to be wealthy. They are very good procrastinators.

### Occurence
During lifetime, kapha energy is most abundant during childhood. During the year, kapha energy is most abundant during winter and spring. During the day, kapha energy is most intense between 6 and 10. When kapha energy is intense, it tends to become out of balance and it is advised to decrease it with opposite qualities.

### Physical patterns
People with kapha constitution are generally well developed, with large body frames, and tend to be overweight. Their general features are: expanded and broad chest, not visible bones, veins, and muscle tendons, well developed muscles, fair and bright complexion, cold, pale, soft, lustrous, and oily skin, dark, soft, thick, and wavy hair, dense, blue or black eyes, large and attractive eyes with very white sclerae and long, thick eyelashes and eyebrows.

### Physiology
People with kapha constitution have a slow metabolism and digestion, and regular appetites. They tend to eat and drink small quantities at one meal. They tend towards sweet, salty and oily foods, although they are balanced by itter, astringent and pungent tastes. They have moderate to low elimination (bowel movements, perspiration, urine). They have a sound and prolonged leep, usually above 8 hours and have difficulties waking up and getting out of bed. They have good stamina and endurance to effort.

### Psychological patterns
People with kapha constitution are generally healthy, happy and peaceful. They are tolerant, calm, forgiving, loving, have slow comprehension, but with complete recall and long-term memory. They have sweet, loving dispositions, and are stable and grounded. They have emotional tendencies toward greed, attachment, envy and possessiveness.
