## Overview
In the physical body, vata--composed of Space and Air--is the subtle energy associated with movement. Vata provides the essential motion for all bodily processes and is extremely vital for health. It governs breathing, blinking, muscle and tissue movement, pulsation of the heart, and all movements in the cytoplasm and cell membranes. In balance, vata promotes creativity and flexibility. Out of balance, vata produces fear and anxiety.

## Vata constitution
### Balance
The most important way to balance vata energy is to stabilise and 'ground' its dynamism and motion. Regular routines and relaxation are the key factors that balance vata. Excess vata energy is balanced by warmth, moisture, oiliness, and heaviness.

### Gifts
Vata promotes creativity, enthusiasm, flexibility, and rapid thinking.

### Imbalance factors
Vata energy is increased by its qualities ('Like increases like') and, thus, becomes imbalanced. Traveling, loud noises, constant stimulation, lack of rest, drugs, sugar, alcohol, cold, and cold foods imbalance vata. Like the wind, vata types have a hard time becoming and staying grounded. Routine is difficult but essential if vata is to be lowered and controlled.

### Imbalance signs
When vata energy is high, people with vata constitution tend to become anxious, fearful, and nervous. They may also notice symptoms as: flatulence, tics, twitches, aching joints, dry skin and hair, nerve disorders, constipation, and mental confusion. Their common type of diseases are air based (e.g. arthritis, emphysema, pneumonia).

### Location
Vata resides in the colon, as well as the brain, ears, bones, joints, skin and thighs.

### Management
People with vata constitution earn money quickly, but also spend it quickly, hence, they tend to be poor. They are not good planners, have bad organisational skills, and tend to be messy in their work. They are very initiative in starting new projects, but have problems with finishing them.

### Occurance
During lifetime, vata energy increases as we age, hence, the skin becomes dry and with wrinckled. During the year, vata energy is most abundant in autumn and during season transititions. During the day, vata energy is most intense between 2 and 6. When vata energy is intense, it tends to become out of balance and it is advised to decrease it with opposite qualities.

### Physical patterns
People with vata constitution are generally physically underdeveloped, tend to be underweight, skinny, with thin body frames, and are taller or shorter than average people. Their general feature are: flat and sunken chests, visible bones, joints, muscle tendons, and veins, brown complexion, cold, cracked, dry, and rough skin, curly and scanty hair, thin eyelishes and eyebrows, active, dry, and small eyes, brittle and rough nails, cold hands and feet. 

### Physiology
People with vata constitution have a variable appetite and digestion. They tend towards astringent foods like salad and vegetables, although they are balanced by sweet, sour and salty tastes. They have a poor elimination (bowel movements, perspiration, urine).

### Psychological patterns
People with vata constitution are alert, restless, and very active. They are always in a rush and on the go. They walk, talk, and think fast, but are easily fatigued. They have less willpower and often feel unstable and ungrounded. They have less tolerance, confidence and boldness. They have tendency to mood changes. They have a short memory and tend to forget as fast as they learn.

### Qualities
Vata is defined as clear, cold, dispersing, dry, dynamic, light, rough, and subtle,
