## Overview
Pitta is a force created from the combination of Fire and Water. It is the energy that maintains all metabolic functions (e.g. digestion, absorption, assimilation, nutrition, metabolism, and body temperature). In balance, pitta promotes understanding and intelligence. When out of balance, pitta promotes anger, hatred, and jealousy.

## Pitta constitution
### Balance
The most important way to balance pitta energy is to cool down its 'boiling' and firy nature. Relaxation and staying cool are the key factors that balance pitta. Excess pitta energy is balanced by coolness, lightness, and driness.

### Characteristics
Pitta is defined as acidic, agitating, fluid, hot, light, mobile, oily, penetrating, sharp, and transformation.

### Imbalance factors
Pitta energy is increased by its qualities ('Like increases like') and, thus, becomes imbalanced. Heat, sunlight, hard work, and spicy foods imbalance pitta.

### Imbalance signs
When pitta energy is high, it accumulates in its body locations. Generally, people with pitta constitution tend to become agitated, aggressive with tendency towards anger, hate, and jealousy. They may also notice symptoms as: skin rashes, burning sensation, ulceration, fever, inflammations or irritations such as conjunctivitis, colitis, or sore throats. Their common type of diseases are fire based (e.g. fever, inflammation, and jaundice).

### Location
Pitta resides in the small intestine, liver, spleen, pancreas, blood, eyes, and sweat.

### Management
People with pitta constitution are ambitious people who generally like to be leaders. They appreciate material prosperity and tend to be moderately well-off financially. They enjoy exhibiting their wealth and luxurious possessions. They always achieve their goals and take their projects to conclusion.

### Occurence
During lifetime, pitta energy is most abundant during teenage years and adulthood. During the year, pitta energy is most abundant around summer. During the day, pitta energy is most intense between 10 and 2. When pitta energy is intense, it tends to become out of balance and it is advised to decrease it with opposite qualities.
